        <em>home, take off ur shoes before entering</em>

        <p>i wanna make an <a 
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA" 
          target="_blank"
          >SPA page</a> so that I dont have to worry about my assets not getting converted. that or i can figure out how to use vite, vue AND firebase together—i keep getting errors :/
        </p>

        <ul>
          anyways here are some thoughts:
          <ol>
            <li>
              my <em style="color: darkviolet">daily screentime</em> has been 1 hr on average for around 4 weeks now ... no idea what to do with that time tho
            </li>
            <li>
              was sick for the 3 day weekend but i am better now, <em style="color: darkorange">life is very boring rn</em> bc we r not learning anymore, just reviewing
            </li>
            <li>
              currently <em style="color: darkturquoise">bored of french</em>, its just any other language to me now — how to keep up the momentum?
            </li>
          </ol>
          <br />
          <li>
            books im reading: 
            <ol>
              <li>
                immortality — kundera / i sorta forgot abt this book just because, difficult to digest, engaging, author has rizz
              </li>
              <li>
                a very easy death - simone de beauvoir / havent read her in a while since <em style="color:dodgerblue">the woman destroyed</em> but shes as articulate as always. 
                this time around, its a particularly tender episode of her life. i wonder: how will she write about her mother's death with her usual wit?
              </li>
            </ol>
        </ul>
